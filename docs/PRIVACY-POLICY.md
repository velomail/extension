# VeloMail Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2025

VeloMail ("we", "our") is a browser extension that helps you optimize sales emails for mobile viewing. This policy describes how we handle information in the extension.

## Data we store

VeloMail stores the following data **only on your device** using the browser's local storage (Chrome's `chrome.storage.local`):

- **Settings:** Your preferences (e.g. tip notifications on or off).
- **Onboarding state:** Whether you have completed the welcome/onboarding flow so we do not show it again.
- **Usage milestones:** Local counters (e.g. number of emails previewed) used only to show optional tips or celebrate progress inside the extension.

We do **not** collect, send, or upload this data to any server. All of it stays on your computer.

## Data we do not collect

We do not collect, store, or transmit:

- The content of your emails
- Your email address, name, or contact list
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

## Permissions and why we use them

- **Storage:** To save your settings and onboarding state locally on your device.
- **Active tab:** To know when you are composing mail so we can show the preview and tips in context.
- **Notifications / Alarms:** To optionally show in-app tips (e.g. reminder to try the preview). These are local only.
- **Host access (Gmail, Outlook):** So the extension can run on mail.google.com and outlook.live.com / office.com to display the mobile preview and run the in-page UI. We do not read or send your email content to any third party.

## Changes

We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the extension after changes means you accept the updated policy.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, contact us through your preferred channel (e.g. the support or contact option listed for VeloMail in the Chrome Web Store or on our website).
